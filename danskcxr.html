                <p> Work done for the AI4XRay project at University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with Rigshospitalet, is the largest public and teaching hospital in Copenhagen.
                    The project was challenging as only few annotations were available (~2,500) and the dataset was not in English, while the vast majority of available methods 
                    are developed to work only for English speakers. Additionally, the target label set was multi-class (positive or negative abnormality mention, or no mention) 
                    and multi-label (49 possible abnormalities).
                    I developed and tested methods based on multilingual language models, comparing them to traditional 
                    natural language processing technique.

                <p> The results of this project were <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-2688/6/2/37">published</a> at the journal AI 2025, 6(2), 37.
